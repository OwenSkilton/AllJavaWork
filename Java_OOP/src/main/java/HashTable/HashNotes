                                HASH TABLE

 - Hash table and an array are both structures that allow you to
   store and retrieve data

 - Both allow you to specify an index and retrieve a value associated with it

 - Difference is that the indicies of an array are sequential
   while a hash table are based on the value of the data associated
   with them

   =================================================
        Array           Hash table
    Key ¦ Value ¦       Key ¦ Value ¦
    -------------       -------------
     0  ¦  Yeet ¦       Mike¦ Yeet  ¦
     1  ¦  Yoot ¦       Owen¦ Yoot  ¦
     2  ¦  Yort ¦        Tim¦ Yort  ¦
     3  ¦  Yonk ¦       Boii¦ Yonk  ¦

 - Can provide efficient way to search items in large data amounts
 - Particularly data that is not otherwise easily searchable
    - Large means FUCKING ENORMOUS. Long time to preform sequential search

 - Any non-null object can be used as a key or value
 - HashTable similar to HashMap except it is synchronized

                                HashMap

 - HashMap is a Map based collection used for storing key & value pairs.
 - Denoted as:
    - HashMap<Key, Value> or
    - HashMap<K, V>
 - Similar to HashTable class except that it is unsynchronized and
   permits nulls ( one null key and multiple values)

                          Comparing Two Objects

 - Java Object class provides 2 important methods to compare 2 objects:
    - equals()
    &
    - hashCode()
 - When we override the equals() method, it is necessary to override the hashCode() method
 - Hashcode() method states that equal objects must have equal hashcodes

 - equals():
    - Compares the equality of 2 objects
    - Will be equal if they share the same memory address

Difference between == operator and equals Method:

 - == operator compares that 2 references are identical or not
 - Where as equals() compares 2 objects
 - Object are equal when they have the same state (usually comparing variables)


                          Java HashCode() Method

 - Hash code is a 32-bit signed integer value
 - Unique ID provided by JVM to java object
 - Each Java object is associated with the hash code
 - Hash code is managed by hash-based data =structure, HashTable, HashSet, etc
 - Syntax:
    - public int hashcode()
 - Returns randomly generated hash code value of the object that is unique for each instance
 - Value may change during several executions of program
